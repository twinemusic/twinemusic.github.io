    <pre>Darling I want to be open
Up from the inside
Deer in the headlights
Nothing will move
if you don't want it to
Now every dog that is barking
is barking at me
Oh i need to get moving
nothing good comes from nothing 
Darling I want to be open
Up from the inside 
Deer in the headlights 
Nothing will move 
if you do’nt want it to 

Now every dog that is barking
Is barking at me 
Oh i need to get moving 
Nothing good comes from nothing

There is promise there is lack
Hung up on the byline 
Oh i want to push through
A rock in the pave line 
How long can i get to know you

I’ve forgotten how to hold 
And be held
Lets make up a new name 
One foot on the platform
One foot on the train
One foot on the platform
One foot on the train </pre>

  <button class="song-title" onclick="toggleLyrics(this)">Faith of Crisis</button>
  <div class="lyrics-content">
    <pre>A hard stomp on dog collar
Whiplash round the tree
Held under the microscope
The light is unbecoming
Black hole in the backseat 
Just like I was when I was 15 
In my Hotbox teenage dream 
No air left for burning 

It’s my faith of crisis 
And it’ll happen again 
And again again again again again 

Saw god on the back of a Corolla 
Crashed into a stobie pole 
Wrapped around like a chocolate wrapper 
Comic Sans “god saves us all”

Now it’s like I’m back to praying 
Guilt soaked after masturbating 
It was never my fault 
A squashed bug under all that came before 

It’s my faith of crisis
It’s my faith of crisis 
It’s my faith of crisis
It’ll happen
again again again again again again 
Again again again again again again 
</pre>
  </div>

  <button class="song-title" onclick="toggleLyrics(this)">Out The Same Way</button>
  <div class="lyrics-content">
    <pre>Behind every open door
Runs a backwards racking dog
Every bet I'm hedging
Placed on everything I'm not
Every step up the hill is up some tempered glass
Let the good times roll
And let them pass
Sliding down with bare ass
The fool

Now every night has
That same old feeling
Of packing up my things and leaving 
Every wall requires a new stance
So I pull my limbs into repeating patterns 
Caught with my hands down my pants 
Waiting for some new romance
The fool

I gotta put my dog down 
He’s all bark and no bite 
With my hands down my pants
well it aint what it looks like
Coughing and splutter down the old highway 
The wind will clip my wings 
Out the same way I came in 
Out the same way I came in 
Out the same way I came in 
Out the same way I came in 
Out the same way I came in 
Out the same way I came in 
Out the same way I came in 
Out the same way I came in </pre>

  <h2>NEW OLD HORSE (LP) - Released December 6th 2024</h2>
   <p class="liner-notes">Recorded by Matt Schultz at Interim Studios Adelaide<br>Mixed by Alex Farrar<br>Mastered by Greg Obis</p>

  <button class="song-title" onclick="toggleLyrics(this)">Future Exhales</button>
  <div class="lyrics-content">
    <pre>Drifting down on the east side
Past the corner I broke all my bones
Well the engine ain’t healthy
Spitting fire and smoke

It’s just the line that I tow
Between deep breaths and pool laps and an early onset stroke

Did it all just to feel quite the same
Flipped the car over broke the window pane
Future exhales and old breaths

I’m a plastic pony with a broken leg
And the heat of the street melts my chest
</pre>
  </div>

  <button class="song-title" onclick="toggleLyrics(this)">Sleeping Dogs</button>
  <div class="lyrics-content">
    <pre>I see oceans 
dribble into a single path 
A new horizon I left 

Just a tourist in your eyes 
Only passing through 
Always passing through 

I cried my whole way down 
The water slide
I’ve been scared before
Take me back to the heights 

Get back in an instant 
Or 20 hours on a plane 
But It’s just as you left it 

Everything’s changing 
But nothing has changed 

Sleeping dogs don’t dream 
Of living inside 

Your leash 
My neck 
Stop pulling it

Cigarette in the morning
But there’s nothing to be found 
I guess the itch that I was scratching 
Has scratched itself out 

Baby when the blues come back
Please don’t wait for me 
I’ll be coming when I’m coming  
I’ll be coming when I’m coming  
When your dog whistle calls to me
</pre>
  </div>

  <button class="song-title" onclick="toggleLyrics(this)">Spine</button>
  <div class="lyrics-content">
    <pre>Hiding underneath the play ground 
I piss my pants and play around 
I flop around like a fish 
No pressure 

Well I sure feel that pressure now 
I spit out words to wet the ground
Let the mud surround me now 
It Blocks my ears so I can’t think 

I ask my spine to finally show 
And For my body to just let go 

Hunched over muscles pull
But the back won’t bend straight 
Lifetime waiting for limeglught 
Talent show I slipped on my face 

I drive around just to drive around
I’ve never had a destination
I look around to where the sun is now  
With all my new horizons are all set

I ask my spine to finally show 
And For my body to just let go 
I ask my spine to finally show 
And For my body to just let go 
</pre>
  </div>

  <button class="song-title" onclick="toggleLyrics(this)">New Cleaner</button>
  <div class="lyrics-content">
    <pre>Many hands makes light work 
But lately I find everything 
Is making light work of me

They never notice me 
Only notice when the bathrooms unclean
Working just to keep working 

I cook to clean every day 
But no one in this house knows my name 
What’s the point in anything anyway 
Everything gets dirty in the end 

This is how I spend my time 
Cleaning the rooms trying to clear my mind 
Of all the lovers I’ve left behind 

I re arrange her room 
Put everything back to how she used to 
All the drawers I never can go through 

It’s the grit between the tiles 
Vacant faces and half smiles
What’s the point in anything anyway
Everything gets dirty in the end
</pre>
  </div>

  <button class="song-title" onclick="toggleLyrics(this)">Same Old Problems</button>
  <div class="lyrics-content">
    <pre>I write new names for the same old problems
I try to make it fit
I try to make it work
and I'm not getting better
I'm getting used to dealing with it

Always walking to the same bed
In the wrong fucking house
Always trying to figure it out
They say practice makes perfect
But I've been waking up every single day
No matter how many times I sleep
I've never felt awake

I'll bury my bones in the yard
Cause pushing things down feels like a fresh start

It's always tell them that I said hi
Drive by smiles and a wave goodbye
Well yeah it's lonely on the other end
but i've felt lonelier before
I cant find a way
Every path is blocked
then all of my friends say
you can't give up on what you've lost
I try my best to work through it all
To work through all the shit
It's been a year since Sam passed away
If she was here she wouldn't have dealt with it
From the right angles you can see right through
When things don't work out how you want them to
I try to find a reason
but noting seems to make sense
I've been staring at myself in the bathroom mirror
It only tells me what I want it to
Who I am and what I've been
It's getting fucking old
spending too much time in the sun
No matter how hard thing's get
There isn't much more I can forget
</pre>
  </div>

  <button class="song-title" onclick="toggleLyrics(this)">My God</button>
  <div class="lyrics-content">
    <pre>My god came to me
Through the screen of my tv
Because Something won’t happen
And something won’t break

His eyes flutter with a reason
Skin burns with all seasons
Hands pulled the switch
And set me ablaze

An itchy trigger finger
That I’ll never get to press
Maybe in some time
The dogs will stop barking yet

He won’t skirt around the edges
The deep end is not profound
John frum is finally coming
Got his eyes to the ground

Stench of fish stings my mind
Like A lost child down isle 9
Nothing grows so nothing rots
Nothing else makes me feel so hot
</pre>
  </div>

  <button class="song-title" onclick="toggleLyrics(this)">Fruit To Ripe</button>
  <div class="lyrics-content">
    <pre>Unfurl me from the inside darling 
I want my fruit to ripe 
1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 counting 
My fruitless mess in spite 
I’ll be your baby if you want me 
Pants down flailing about 
I’ll fly to every new horizon 
Till my beak hits the glass 

Rip me open from from the inside darling
I want to be your star 
Hold me under the black light shining 
chalk body outline in cum 
123 123 123 counting 
Deep Breaths into an empty lung
123 123 123
I love myself I love my body 

123

  </div>

  <button class="song-title" onclick="toggleLyrics(this)">Between States</button>
  <div class="lyrics-content">
    <pre>Pulled the cards out from the deck 
said be afraid of what’s coming next 
Don’t be sad that it happened 
Just be sorry that I did 
It’s a long time between states 
Where the border lines won’t meet
For a couple days 
What’s to try to feel the same 
Left out to dry 
Hung up In the rain 

The first one to walk
Last one to cross the line 
Hate me for it all 
But darling there was so much more 
If we had the time 
Your soldered to the chair 
While I’m lying there
Naked on the floor
Darling I’m heading for the door
</pre>
  </div>

  <button class="song-title" onclick="toggleLyrics(this)">New Old Horse</button>
  <div class="lyrics-content">
    <pre>An oil leak out of the socket 
Soaks the colour out the floor 
I get queasy on the start up 
I was hungry when I was younger 

All the shit I put into my body
Came out from the kitchen sink 
That fucking rat comes knocking 
Eating all my cheese

I knew it when I saw it 
Oh my body hates me
The grass it was growing out from underneath the kitchen 

That old horse riding like death 
Kicks me in the head again 
I want to be 3 feet from me 
finding emptiness inside every thing 
</pre>
  </div>

  <button class="song-title" onclick="toggleLyrics(this)">High Tide / Loose Change</button>
  <div class="lyrics-content">
    <pre>ll bury him here someday 
Mixing up the bones and the clay 
I won’t ever let this die 
Taxidermied kept alive 
I see the list dwindle each year 
the fire licks behind your ears 
I felt the lump before the swell 
Autumns burning winters hell 

Turn me around 
I know what we’ll say 
Everything burns 
All time and a place just
High tide / loose change 
Old joy 
New rage

So this is me being selfish 
Some rhinestone cowboy parading round
Marking my proud sale 
Pierece two posts in the ground
Profit over all in a competitive market 
Cash for gold 
I’m sold as the next best thing 
Every hoof prints a punch in the face
Im the kid who cried at your birthday 
I’m the dog off the leash 
Biting the hand that feeds me 

Memory just turns to twist the knife
I’ve cleaned that wound 100 times 
I felt the lump before the swell 
Autumns burning winters hell 

Forever don’t mean much in passing 
Forgotten don’t mean that’s it done 
A joke was that went too far 
The dog that bit my arm 

Forever don’t mean much in passing 
Forgotten don’t mean that’s it done 
A joke was that went too far 
The dog that bit my arm
